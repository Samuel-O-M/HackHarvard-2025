# Hearsay - Quick Start Guide

Get Hearsay running in 5 minutes!

## What You'll Need

- **Python 3.8+** - Backend server
- **Node.js 16+** - Frontend interface  
- **API Keys** (free tiers work fine):
  - Google Gemini: [makersuite.google.com/app/apikey](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
  - ElevenLabs: [elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io/)

## Installation

### Step 1: Get API Keys

1. **Google Gemini**
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Copy your key

2. **ElevenLabs**
   - Visit [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/)
   - Sign up (free tier available)
   - Go to Profile ‚Üí Copy API key

### Step 2: Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:

```
GEMINI=your_gemini_api_key_here
ELEVENLABS=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
```

**Important:** The `.env` file must be in the same directory as this QUICKSTART.md file.

### Step 3: Start Backend

Open a terminal:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

You should see:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

**Backend is ready!** ‚úì

### Step 4: Start Frontend

Open a **new terminal** (keep backend running):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
VITE ready in xxx ms
Local: http://localhost:3000
```

**Frontend is ready!** ‚úì

### Step 5: Start Learning

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click **"Manage"** in the navigation
3. Add your first word:
   - **Foreign Language:** `hola`
   - **English:** `hello`
   - Click **"Add Word"** (wait 10-20 seconds for AI generation)
4. Click **"Study"** to review your first card!
5. Click **"Stats"** to see your progress

**You're all set!** üéâ

## Optional: Hardware Setup

Want to use physical buttons or gesture sensors? 

See the [Hardware Quick Start Guide](hardware/QUICKSTART.md) for detailed instructions.

**Quick version:**
1. Connect Arduino with buttons or sensors
2. Upload the Arduino sketch
3. Edit `hardware/config.py` with your backend URL
4. Run `python hardware_buttons.py` or `python hardware_sensors.py`

## Common Issues

### "ModuleNotFoundError" when starting backend

**Fix:** Make sure you're in the backend directory and ran `pip install -r requirements.txt`

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "GEMINI API key not found"

**Fix:** Check that your `.env` file is in the **project root**, not inside backend/ or frontend/

```
Project Root/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env          ‚Üê Should be here
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hardware/
```

### Port 8000 or 3000 already in use

**Fix:** Kill the process using that port:

```bash
# Kill port 8000
npx kill-port 8000

# Kill port 3000
npx kill-port 3000
```

Or change the port in the config files (see detailed guides).

### Frontend shows "Network Error"

**Fix:** Make sure the backend is running on port 8000. Check the backend terminal for errors.

### Audio files not generating

**Fix:** Verify your ElevenLabs API key is correct in the `.env` file. Free tier has monthly character limits.

### Nothing happens when I add a word

**Fix:** Wait 10-20 seconds‚Äîthe AI is generating your sentence. Check the browser console (F12) for error messages.

## How to Use Hearsay

### Adding Words

1. Go to the **Manage** page
2. Enter a foreign language word and its English translation
3. Click "Add Word"
4. Wait ~15 seconds while AI generates a contextual sentence
5. Audio files are created automatically

### Studying

1. Go to the **Study** page
2. Listen to the word and sentence (click üîä icons)
3. Try to recall the meaning
4. Click "Show Answer" to reveal the translation
5. Rate how well you knew it:
   - **Again** (üò∞) - Forgot completely
   - **Hard** (üòï) - Very difficult
   - **Good** (üôÇ) - Recalled with effort
   - **Easy** (üòÑ) - Instant recall

### Tracking Progress

1. Go to the **Stats** page
2. View your learning metrics:
   - Total words and cards
   - Cards due today
   - Review count
   - Retention rate
   - Learning timeline

## Using Hardware (Optional)

Once you've set up the hardware controllers:

### Button Controls

Press any button while on the Study page:
- **Button 1** ‚Üí Show answer + rate as Hard
- **Button 2** ‚Üí Show answer + rate as Medium
- **Button 3** ‚Üí Show answer + rate as Good
- **Button 4** ‚Üí Show answer + rate as Easy

### Gesture Controls

Wave your hand near a sensor (3-step gesture):
1. Place hand near sensor (< 30cm)
2. Wait 1 second
3. Remove hand
4. Rating is submitted!

- **Sensor X** ‚Üí Hard rating
- **Sensor Y** ‚Üí Good rating

## System Check

Everything is working if:

```
‚úì Backend: http://localhost:8000 shows "Language Learning API is running"
‚úì Frontend: http://localhost:3000 shows the Hearsay interface
‚úì Can add words in Manage page (wait for AI generation)
‚úì Can study cards in Study page
‚úì Stats page shows your metrics
‚úì Audio plays when you click the üîä icons
```

## Getting Help

### Check the Logs

- **Backend errors:** Look in the terminal where you ran `python main.py`
- **Frontend errors:** Press F12 in your browser ‚Üí Console tab
- **Hardware errors:** Look in the terminal where you ran the Python script

### Common Questions

**Q: How much do the API keys cost?**  
A: Both have free tiers that work great for personal use. ElevenLabs: 10k characters/month. Gemini: Generous free quota.

**Q: Can I use this without hardware?**  
A: Yes! The web interface works perfectly on its own. Hardware is optional for accessibility.

**Q: What languages are supported?**  
A: Any language supported by ElevenLabs TTS and Google Gemini (most major languages).

**Q: How does the spaced repetition work?**  
A: We use FSRS, which calculates optimal review timing based on your performance. Better than traditional algorithms!

**Q: Can I export my data?**  
A: Yes! Your data is in `backend/database.json` (JSON format) and `backend/audio/` (MP3 files).
